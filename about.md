Zamin Iqbal runs a group at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, at the University of Oxford. Take a look at his [departmental webpage](http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/iqbal) to get more information on the research we do. Right now, the group has 3 fantastic PhD students (Phelim Bradley, Sorina Maciuca, Rachel Norris). We are recruiting for a [Web App Developer](http://www.recruit.ox.ac.uk/pls/hrisliverecruit/erq_jobspec_version_4.jobspec?p_id=118986) to join us, to work on webapps allowing querying of massive bacterial genomic datasets, looking at world diversity and antibiotic resistance profiles - see our [Mykrobe predictor](http://mykrobe.com).
